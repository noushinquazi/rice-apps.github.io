# PM Sample Documentation:
Documentation is an important aspect of managing a project or product. Ultimately, since universities experience churn, we want to ensure that project members can record any important learnings or discoveries. Additionally, it's useful to understand how the app was built - this helps with new members joining a team and those investigating any issues.  

We would expect this sample documentation to evolve over time to fit the needs and demands of the organization and project.
