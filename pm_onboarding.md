### Introduction to Rice Apps
#### Background:
Rice Apps is a student-run computer science organization that desires to create value to the Rice local community and its student members through 1) the delivery of value-adding apps, and 2) teaching its members how to code (the Computer Science program is highly theoretical in its course structure, so this is their first exposure to coding).

#### Proposed Organization:

#### Rice Apps Work Process:
Rice Apps meets twice a week. Each team determines the day of the week and time that they will meet to conduct their scrum session. Then on Saturdays, they will meet from 1-4pm to code.  
Product managers should work with their teams to determine what times are best for scrums.

#### Jones Tech Club Work Process:
Tech Club PM’s will be expected to join the team during their scrum sessions. It is recommended but not mandatory to join the teams on Saturdays from 1-4pm. During other times, it is important for Tech PM’s to understand their customer and develop their skills or roadmap.

Our structure will continue to change and adjust throughout the semester as we determine best practices and trial ideas. We also hold one weekly PM stand-up with the intention of sharing updates and challenges.

#### Role of Jones Tech Club
During the course of their work in the Fall Semester 2018, Rice Apps has identified a need for those who can be more dedicated in talking to customers and advising their product owners on the direction of the product.

The role of the Jones Tech Club product managers will be to serve as the voice of the customer, ensuring that the product decisions will be to the benefit of the end-user. They will need to play both an advisory and collaborative role with the product owner. They will need to both help the product owner with any issues that may arise and work with the product owner on determining the future of the product.

This imitates the role that product managers will often play in organizations, where they do not have the **power or ownership** but need to create buy-in amongst their stakeholders. As this is a key learning experience for Rice Apps, we also want this to be an educational experience for Tech Club participants to gain valuable hands-on experience about product management in a lower pressure environment.

For any issues, please reach out to the Rice Apps president or Jones Tech Club president. For additional guidance or input, please also ask Dr. Panahi.

### Pre-Semester Preparation

#### Principles of Agile
Agile is a development methodology demonstrating a commitment to iterative workflows. It was originally derived from a meeting of software minds, who came together and set the following principles, in what’s known as the Agile Manifesto:

While we will not be memorizing these principles, you may want to be familiar with them, especially if you want to be agile certified.
