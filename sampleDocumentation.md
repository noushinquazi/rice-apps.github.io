# PM Sample Documentation:
Documentation is an important aspect of managing a project or product. Ultimately, since universities experience churn, we want to ensure that project members can record any important learnings or discoveries. Additionally, it's useful to understand how the app was built - this helps with new members joining a team and those investigating any issues.  

## Sample Documnet
We would expect this sample documentation to evolve over time to fit the needs and demands of the organization and project.  

Project Name:  
Team Members:  

### Onboarding Reflection: 
What did you take away from your onboarding experience? What was it like to join the team? What do you wish could be improved? How could your workflow be improved?  

### Customer problem identified:
What is the core issue that the customer encountered? What is the customer problem that you are trying to solve for?

### Solutions brainstormed:
What are the possible solutions that have been brought up? Why were they discarded?

### Solution identified:
What was the option that was selected? Why was it picked?

### Launch process: 
How will you intend on getting the product to the customer? What is the goal of the launch?

### Customer journey:
**Front-end:** What is the user doing on their screen?  

**Back-end:** As the user is using your app, what is going on in the back-end?

### Usage policies:
What kind of policies does your app have? Moderation, privacy, community guidelines, etc.

### Roadmap (current):
What is the most recent roadmap? Remember, the roadmap is a living document that consistently updates based on the team's progress and changing requirements of the customer. It's important to prioritize the roadmap well.

### Roadmap (original):
What was the original roadmap? Having the two roadmaps side-by-side should be useful for understanding the delays. After the project, you can discuss what happened to the time lag.

## Appendix:
### Research Findings & Learnings:
1) Issue encountered  
2) Research performed (if any): what was done to solve the problem?  
3) Conclusions: what was the solution?  
4) Links (if any): source  

### Other reusable learnings:

### Learnings from launch:
What takeaways did you have from launching the app?
