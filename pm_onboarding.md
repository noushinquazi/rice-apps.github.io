### Introduction to Rice Apps
#### Background:
Rice Apps is a student-run computer science organization that desires to create value to the Rice local community and its student members through 1) the delivery of value-adding apps, and 2) teaching its members how to code (the Computer Science program is highly theoretical in its course structure, so this is their first exposure to coding).

#### Proposed Organization:

#### Rice Apps Work Process:
Rice Apps meets twice a week. Each team determines the day of the week and time that they will meet to conduct their scrum session. Then on Saturdays, they will meet from 1-4pm to code.  
Product managers should work with their teams to determine what times are best for scrums.
