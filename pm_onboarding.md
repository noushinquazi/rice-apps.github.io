###Introduction to Rice Apps
####Background:
Rice Apps is a student-run computer science organization that desires to create value to the Rice local community and its student members through 1) the delivery of value-adding apps, and 2) teaching its members how to code (the Computer Science program is highly theoretical in its course structure, so this is their first exposure to coding).
